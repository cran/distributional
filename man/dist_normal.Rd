\title{The Normal distribution}
\usage{
dist_normal(mu = 0, sigma = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{mu}{The mean (location parameter) of the distribution, which is also
the mean of the distribution. Can be any real number.}

\item{sigma}{The standard deviation (scale parameter) of the distribution.
Can be any positive number. If you would like a Normal distribution with
\strong{variance} \eqn{\sigma^2}, be sure to take the square root, as this is a
common source of errors.}

\details{
The Normal distribution is ubiquitous in statistics, partially because
of the central limit theorem, which states that sums of i.i.d. random
variables eventually become Normal. Linear transformations of Normal
random variables result in new random variables that are also Normal. If
you are taking an intro stats course, you'll likely use the Normal
distribution for Z-tests and in simple linear regression. Under
regularity conditions, maximum likelihood estimators are
asymptotically Normal. The Normal distribution is also called the
gaussian distribution.

We recommend reading this documentation on
\url{https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/distributional/}, where the math
will render nicely.

In the following, let \eqn{X} be a Normal random variable with mean
\code{mu} = \eqn{\mu} and standard deviation \code{sigma} = \eqn{\sigma}.

\strong{Support}: \eqn{R}, the set of all real numbers

\strong{Mean}: \eqn{\mu}

\strong{Variance}: \eqn{\sigma^2}

\strong{Probability density function (p.d.f)}:

\deqn{
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / 2 \sigma^2}
  }{
    f(x) = 1 / (2 \pi \sigma^2) exp(-(x - \mu)^2 / (2 \sigma^2))
  }

\strong{Cumulative distribution function (c.d.f)}:

The cumulative distribution function has the form

\deqn{
    F(t) = \int_{-\infty}^t \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / 2 \sigma^2} dx
  }{
    F(t) = integral_{-\infty}^t 1 / (2 \pi \sigma^2) exp(-(x - \mu)^2 / (2 \sigma^2)) dx
  }

but this integral does not have a closed form solution and must be
approximated numerically. The c.d.f. of a standard Normal is sometimes
called the "error function". The notation \eqn{\Phi(t)} also stands
for the c.d.f. of a standard Normal evaluated at \eqn{t}. Z-tables
list the value of \eqn{\Phi(t)} for various \eqn{t}.

\strong{Moment generating function (m.g.f)}:

\deqn{
    E(e^{tX}) = e^{\mu t + \sigma^2 t^2 / 2}
  }{
    E(e^(tX)) = e^(\mu t + \sigma^2 t^2 / 2)
  }
}
