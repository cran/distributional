\title{Highest density regions of probability distributions}
\usage{
\method{hdr}{distribution}(x, size = 95, n = 512, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The distribution(s).}

\item{size}{The size of the interval (between 0 and 100).}

\item{n}{The resolution used to estimate the distribution's density.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments used by methods.}

\description{
\lifecycle{experimental}
}
\details{
This function is highly experimental and will change in the future. In
particular, improved functionality for object classes and visualisation tools
will be added in a future release.

Computes minimally sized probability intervals highest density regions.
